		<h1>To the internet, from me.</h1>
		<p>&quot;When it&apos;s all said and done, the Wired is just a medium of communication and the transfer of information. You mustn&apos;t confuse it with the real world. Do you understand what I&apos;m warning you about?&quot; -- Yasuo Iwakura, Serial Experiments Lain</p>
		<p><br></p>
		<p>This is essentially what attitude we need in the modern day. In this world full of Dopamine Hijacking Subway Surfer Family Guy ADHD filled social media, we need to remember what the web is truly meant to be to us and what purpose it was made to serve.</p>
		<p>The web was envisioned as</p>
		<ul>
		    <li>A tool to share knowledge</li>
		    <li>A medium of self-expression.</li>
		    <li>A place of personal sharing.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>But what its become is a place to shove as many ads down people&apos;s throats, cut down individuality, turn people against each other, and focus on the biggest companies&apos; top dollar at the expense of the users.</p>
		<p>I propose a new movement. A new era past WEB3 and NFTs. Beyond X and whatever Elon Fuck is doing.</p>
		<p>We need to focus on what made the web so fun and creative. Give the web its humanity back. Let people be people.</p>
		<p>To quote webmistress sadgrl, &quot;The internet has normalized debating with each other. In debates, there can only be one &apos;winner&apos;. The net has also normalized a lack of nuance (a gray area in between the two extremes) which tends to be divisive. It would be infinitely more constructive if, instead of debating with others, we started a dialogue, working together &apos;on the same team&apos; as others in order to form a common understanding. This is different than &quot;agreeing to disagree&quot; and more like making an effort to listen and view something from each individual&apos;s perspective. It requires being open to changing your perspective in the first place.&quot;</p>
		<p>We shouldn&apos;t shame others for using social media though. We should advocate for learning to use those platforms in healthier and more humanizing ways.</p>
		<p>No matter if you love making websites or if you casually browse Instagram, we should be more human with how we interact with this box of ideas.</p>
		<p><br></p>
		<p>I will update this page if need be. Remember to stay safe, and be nice.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;We tried to use these machines to express something extremely moving that a machine cannot feel, but a human can. We were always on the side of humanity and not on the side of technology.&rdquo; - Thomas Bangalter.</p>
